# RegionChangerDBD
A simple Dead By Daylight server *region* changer written in Java;
This is only a not complete version, I didn't put a lot of work for it, so there's some features aren't available in the tool, for example, you can't change your region to 'Asia', etc.
This project has been done primarily for the players who are trying to avoid the game's server crashes, it was the goal I've done this project for, I hope it fixes some issues as it was for me.
If you notice anything not working in the tool, you could comment an issue in the github repository page. I will be happy to assert more information and upgrade if some issues appear to happen, as it might cause since variety experiences in different machines differ.

Couple of requirements/tips needed for the program to work:
  1. Download Java.
  2. Open the .bat file, and open it with administrator privilege only.
